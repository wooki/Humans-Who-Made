		<h2>How it works</h2>
		 <p>Just place a humans.txt file on the route of your website containing information
    about your development tream and site and we will hopefully stummble across it in one
    of our hourly internet crawls.</p>
    <p>For best results ensure you follow the guidelines for the <a href="/humans-txt">humans.txt</a> file.</p>

		<h2>Whos idea was this</h2>
		<p>The original idea for a humans.txt file seems to be from the clever chaps at humanstxt.org and I think I
    spotted it via a link on twitter.  Although crawling a file designed specifically for humans seems slightly
    perverse I thought it might be a good candidate for listing this information in a way that non-technical
    people can find it.</p>

		<h2>Statistics</h2>
		<p>The important numbers are how many humans.txt files have we indexed but also what percentage of websites
		we have crawled have a humans.txt file at all.</p>
