		<h2>How it works</h2>
		 <p><em>Humans Who Made</em> crawls the web looking for
	websites that implement the humans.txt standard to determine who was behind
	each site. This has the advantage of ensuring that the people listed on this
	site really do have access to the site they are claiming to	have developed
	and also it allows us to list a huge number of websites and people easily.</p>

		<h2>About humans.txt</h2>
